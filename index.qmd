**I am a political theorist and an Assistant Professor at the College of William and Mary, jointly appointed in the [Department of Government](https://www.wm.edu/as/government/) and the [Africana Studies Program](https://www.wm.edu/as/africanastudies/)**. 

I study the state's interventions into our intimate relationships. My current project examines the many forms of injustice produced by the contemporary foster systems in Britain and the United States.

I also have research interests in quantitatively examining partisan gerrymandering in congressional redistricting, specifically its implications for democratic equality. 

My recent work is forthcoming at the 
*American Journal for Political Science* and *American Political Science Review*. 

I have been a [James M. and Cathleen D. Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration](https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/) and Graduate Fellow at the [Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics](https://ethics.harvard.edu/). I'm affiliated with the [Center for American Political Studies](https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/home), [Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu), the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu), and the [Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project](https://alarm-redist.org/about.html).

### Book Project

:::
::::
:::::
::::::

<br>

My current book project examines the contemporary foster systems in Britain and the United States and critiques these systems for aggravating and compounding injustice. 

To properly understand injustice in the contemporary foster system, I argue that we must correct a conceptual oversight about the definitive power of the system and how it is typically employed: the foster system engages in coercive relational intervention. More specifically, it enacts violence on our intimate relationships when it exercises its power to remove children from their carers. Much of the injustice in the system pertains to the misuse of this power, or, what I call, the capacity to employ *relational violence*. 

An article defending my account of relational violence is available for [Early View](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.70003?af=R) at the *American Journal of Political Science.*
