    "text": "EMMA EBOWE\n\n\n\n  Photo by Melissa Blackall\n\n\nHello! I’m a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University, with a secondary field in African and African American Studies. I was a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration and Graduate Fellow at the Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics. I’m affiliated with the Center for American Political Studies, Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project.\nI am a political theorist whose research focusses on the social, political, and relational injustice produced by the welfare state. I have interests in theories of justice, black political thought, feminist theory, and the state. My recent work proposes ethical and policy correctives for institutional injustice in the foster system and suggests new normative ideals to govern state intervention into intimate family life. I am also interested in partisan gerrymandering in congressional redistricting, specifically its implications for racial justice and democracy, and applied ethics, specifically reparations in higher education contexts."
