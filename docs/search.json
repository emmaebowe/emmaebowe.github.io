    "text": "EMMA EBOWE\n\n\n\n  Photo by Melissa Blackall\n\n\n I am an Assistant Professor of Government and Africana Studies at the College of William and Mary. My research focusses on the social, political, and relational injustice produced by the welfare state.\nI have interests in theories of justice, black political thought, feminist theory, and the state. My recent work proposes ethical and policy correctives for institutional injustice in the foster system and suggests new normative ideals to govern state intervention into intimate family life. I am also interested in partisan gerrymandering in congressional redistricting, specifically its implications for racial justice and democracy.\nI was a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration and Graduate Fellow at the Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics. I’m affiliated with the Center for American Political Studies, Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project."

    "text": "RESEARCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissertation\nMy dissertation, Intimately Bound: Injustice & and the Foster System, examines the foster systems in England and the U.S. as political institutions, and subjects these systems to sustained criticisms of injustice.\nTo properly understand injustice in the contemporary foster system, I argue that we must correct a conceptual oversight about the definitive power of the system and how it is typically employed: the foster system engages in coercive relational intervention. More specifically, it enacts violence on our intimate relationships when it exercises its power to remove children from their carers. Much of the injustice in the system pertains to the misuse of this power, or, what I call, the capacity to employ relational violence.\nAn article defending the main claim of my dissertation about relational violence is currently forthcoming at the American Journal of Political Science. My full dissertation is available upon request.\n\n\nJournal Articles\n“Injustice, Relational Violence, and the Foster System.” American Journal of Political Science, forthcoming.
